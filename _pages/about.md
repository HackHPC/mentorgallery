HackHPC: Empowering the next generation of high-performance computing innovators. This dynamic hackathon series provides undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experience in cutting-edge HPC technologies and practices. Through immersive challenges and collaborative projects, participants develop critical skills essential for advancing scientific research and technological innovation. At the heart of HackHPC’s success are our dedicated mentors—experienced professionals and academics who guide, inspire, and nurture emerging talent. These mentors play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, fostering an environment of creativity and problem-solving. By volunteering their expertise, mentors not only contribute to the growth of individual students but also help shape the future of the HPC community and drive progress in computational science.

Mentor Role:

Mentors play a crucial role in HackHPC events, serving as experienced guides who foster innovation and skill development among participants. Their responsibilities encompass several key areas:

## Guidance and Support

Mentors lead students through the design and development process of responding to a specific challenge or question[1][6]. They provide:

- Expertise in their field, offering insights and advice on technical or non-technical aspects of projects[2]
- Assistance in brainstorming ideas and troubleshooting problems[4]
- Motivation and encouragement to help teams stay focused and overcome obstacles[5]

## Project Management

HackHPC mentors help teams:

- Define clear project goals and deliverables[6]
- Manage time effectively, keeping an eye on the intense schedule[4]
- Divide roles within the team to optimize productivity[4]
- Prepare for final presentations and create necessary documentation[6]

## Skill Development

Mentors contribute to participants' growth by:

- Bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application[2]
- Encouraging exploration and learning by doing, rather than simply providing answers[3]
- Connecting participants with relevant resources and tutorials[5]

## Communication and Collaboration

Effective mentors in HackHPC events:

- Establish open communication channels with their teams[2]
- Facilitate daily check-ins and progress updates[6]
- Foster a collaborative environment that promotes diverse perspectives[3]

By fulfilling these roles, HackHPC mentors not only guide participants through the immediate challenges of the event but also contribute to the broader goal of developing the next generation of high-performance computing innovators.

**Emma Bukowski**
 
 Emma Bukowski is a dedicated Teaching Assistant at Colorado State University, where she is actively engaged in the Higher Education industry. Her academic journey has been marked by a strong passion for High-Performance Computing (HPC) and its applications in climate data and analytics.
 
 Emma's research focus is on the impact of lossy compression on numerical weather prediction data, a critical area in HPC that significantly influences data analysis. Her work involves using enstools to study the effects of lossy compression, integrating these observations into numerical models that describe biogeochemical cycling in surficial sediments. This research not only enhances our understanding of coastal sediment dynamics but also has significant implications for atmospheric CO2 uptake, making her contributions highly relevant to the HPC community.
 
 Emma's experience as a participant in hackathons such as ADMI2023, ADMI2023, and HPCintheCity2023 has been instrumental in shaping her approach to mentoring. These events have provided her with hands-on experience in tackling complex problems under tight deadlines, fostering a unique perspective on the practical applications of HPC. Her participation in these hackathons has also deepened her understanding of the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the role of HPC in driving innovation.
 
 As an undergraduate researcher, Emma brings a fresh and innovative perspective to the field. Her involvement in hackathons has equipped her with the skills to effectively communicate complex technical concepts, making her an excellent mentor for students and researchers alike. Her dedication to mentoring is evident in her ability to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring that her mentees are well-prepared to tackle real-world challenges in climate science and HPC.
 
 Emma's work has the potential to significantly impact climate science by providing more accurate and efficient methods for analyzing large datasets. Her commitment to HPC education and her unique blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience make her an invaluable asset to the HackHPC community. As a mentor, she is poised to inspire and guide the next generation of HPC professionals, fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration that will drive advancements in the field for years to come.

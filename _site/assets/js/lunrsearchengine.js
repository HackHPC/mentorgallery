    "body": "HackHPC: Empowering the next generation of high-performance computing innovators. This dynamic hackathon series provides undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experience in cutting-edge HPC technologies and practices. Through immersive challenges and collaborative projects, participants develop critical skills essential for advancing scientific research and technological innovation. At the heart of HackHPC’s success are our dedicated mentors—experienced professionals and academics who guide, inspire, and nurture emerging talent. These mentors play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, fostering an environment of creativity and problem-solving. By volunteering their expertise, mentors not only contribute to the growth of individual students but also help shape the future of the HPC community and drive progress in computational science. Mentor Role: Mentors play a crucial role in HackHPC events, serving as experienced guides who foster innovation and skill development among participants. Their responsibilities encompass several key areas: Guidance and Support: Mentors lead students through the design and development process of responding to a specific challenge or question[1][6]. They provide:  Expertise in their field, offering insights and advice on technical or non-technical aspects of projects[2] Assistance in brainstorming ideas and troubleshooting problems[4] Motivation and encouragement to help teams stay focused and overcome obstacles[5]Project Management: HackHPC mentors help teams:  Define clear project goals and deliverables[6] Manage time effectively, keeping an eye on the intense schedule[4] Divide roles within the team to optimize productivity[4] Prepare for final presentations and create necessary documentation[6]Skill Development: Mentors contribute to participants’ growth by:  Bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application[2] Encouraging exploration and learning by doing, rather than simply providing answers[3] Connecting participants with relevant resources and tutorials[5]Communication and Collaboration: Effective mentors in HackHPC events:  Establish open communication channels with their teams[2] Facilitate daily check-ins and progress updates[6] Foster a collaborative environment that promotes diverse perspectives[3]By fulfilling these roles, HackHPC mentors not only guide participants through the immediate challenges of the event but also contribute to the broader goal of developing the next generation of high-performance computing innovators.

Her expertise in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and climate data analytics has been honed through her participation in the Gateways2023 hackathons, where she demonstrated a keen understanding of the intersection of HPC and real-world applications. Phillips’ current research focus is on leveraging HPC to enhance climate data analysis, a field that is increasingly critical for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Her work involves developing sophisticated models that can process vast datasets efficiently, thereby providing more accurate and timely insights into climate patterns. This research not only contributes to the advancement of HPC but also has significant implications for climate science, enabling better decision-making and policy formulation. Phillips’ experience as a hackathon participant has profoundly shaped her approach to mentoring. She understands the value of hands-on learning and collaborative problem-solving, skills that are essential for fostering innovation in the HPC community. Her participation in these events has given her a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities in HPC education, allowing her to design curricula that are both rigorous and engaging. As an undergraduate researcher in a cutting-edge field, Phillips brings a fresh and dynamic perspective to the HPC community. Her ability to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application makes her an exceptional mentor. She is well-positioned to inspire and guide students as they navigate the complexities of HPC, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle the most pressing challenges in climate data analytics. Phillips’ potential contributions to the HPC community are substantial. Her work has the potential to not only advance the field of climate science but also to inspire a new generation of researchers and practitioners. As a HackHPC Mentor, she will bring her expertise, enthusiasm, and unique perspective to the table, ensuring that the next wave of HPC professionals is well-equipped to tackle the most complex challenges in climate data analytics.
